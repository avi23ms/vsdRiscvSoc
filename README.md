# 🛠️ Task 1: RISC-V Toolchain Setup and Uniqueness Test 
## 🎯 Objective

Successfully install and configure the RISC-V toolchain in Ubuntu, build and verify Spike (the RISC-V ISA simulator), install the Proxy Kernel, and (optionally) build Icarus Verilog. Finally, compile and run a unique RISC-V C program that prints a user/machine-specific 64-bit hash.
